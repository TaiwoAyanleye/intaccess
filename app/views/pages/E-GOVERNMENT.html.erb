If the consistency of the underlying network infrastructure is not maintained, those services become unreachable and unavailable. Enterprise Management Associates states that between 60 and 80 percent of service-affecting network outages are caused by change, and government organizations must control how change happens in the network and develop efficient ways to roll out changes so that service availability is not impacted.

This means changing civil servants mentality to accept moving from paper and pen to moving to Computers to solve daily complex and simple problems so that these issues have records and are logged efficiently. Also this means that civil servants can be easily monitored to see those who are efficient with work and those who just lag behind.</p>

                                As a healthcare organization, you are confronted with staggering volumes of PHI, PII, and other sensitive data. The aggressive push towards electronic records management, combined with patient information privacy laws, has placed your IT infrastructure under enormous pressure. You need a flexible solution that can handle the vast amount of data, while offering federally-compliant strong security you can depend on.

                                Health care organizations survive and live, as nearly every other business do, on the margin between the cost of providing a service and what can logically be charged for it. Automation provided by Network Configuration Managers reduces the time spent on network configuration tasks from minutes per device to minutes per network, so commonly executed task such as credential rolls, ACL updates and OS updates can be done in a fraction of the time manual processes take. This mean the same staff can be leveraged over many more devices without growth in headcount, accelerating the availability of new services. <br>
                                Our healthcare solutions include: <br>
                                <strong>Health Services Portal:</strong> The health services Portal is the central database for the Hospitals records. The Portal can incorporate CRMs and ERP to help operational efficiency. Also the portal has an eFiling system that helps to file medical records and hospital histories. The solution has the compatibility to run on cloud or in house servers as needed by the hospitals<br>
                            <strong> Medical Tracking Systems:</strong> Our medical tracking system allows for interactions to take place between the Doctors, Nurses, Patients and the Health Services Portal. The system makes uses of radio frequency identification cards and tags that are used for patient registration, medical history and treatments. The treatment monitor feature prompts Doctors and Nurses when a patient’s next treatment is due, when the patient needs to come for another treatment, when the patient is to get surgery and other features as described by the hospital. This solution is fully customizable according to hospital needs. </div>
