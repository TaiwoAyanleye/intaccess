                                <p class="text-med no-margin-bottom sm-margin-bottom-seven">In any educational environment, there is a certain level of attendance to be met, in order for the students to receive grades. At the same time, students are widely recognized for their innovative ideas on how to cheat the system and falsely increase their attendance levels. Using Intaccess identification systems, the chance of fraud is eliminated, as student attendance is verified by their unique biological parameters. Additionally, using biometric identification solutions, your data security levels will reach greater heights.</p>

                                <p class="text-med no-margin-bottom">IntaccessTime allows you to easily monitor student attendance with the help of biometric identification methods. Using unique body parameters, the system is able to instantly and unmistakably verify the identity of students, dismissing the chance of fake registration of attendance. This is also applied for examination purposes as students are granted access into the access hall only when that have been verified using the IntaccessTime device. This way only student verified are allowed to take the exam.</p>

It involves digitizing the curriculum, introducing new topics of interest to the platform, gamifying the subjects to attract and develop inept interest, etc. The beauty of this is that a lot of kids have been exposed to technology. We aim not to discourage them from using these technologies, but to encourage them to use it the right way.</p>
